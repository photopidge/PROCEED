Fish,Poecilia reticulata,Poecilia reticulata,0.575,"from Reznick 1997: ""Guppies breed throughout the year and have overlapping generations. We estimated generation time T using the life table method, which is based on estimates of birth and death schedules in natural populations. We estimated mortality rates from mark-recapture experiments on guppies from seven low-predation localities, including the Aripo and El Cedro experimental sites. Because the life table method requires age-specific survival, we estimated the ages of individuals in different size classes using growth rate equations derived for the same fish in the mark-recapture experiments based on their sizes at the beginning and end of the recapture interval. We estimated size-specific fecundity with dissections and embryo counts from females collected from these same localities, plus from additional collections. We estimated the frequency of reproduction from laboratory studies, conducted at temperatures and food availabilities similar to those in the field. With this information, we estimated the mean generation time of fish in low-predation localities to be 210 days, or 1.74 generations per year"". So, gtime=0.575."

Ambrosia artemisiifolia forms a persistent soil seed bank as aresult of complex germination strategies. Seeds are dormant following their dispersal in autumn. This primary (innate) dormancy is then broken by low winter temperatures (optimallya few days around 4°C) and seeds that donot germinate the next spring enter secondary (induced) dormancy (Essl F, Biró K, Brandes D, Broennimann O, Bullock JM, Chapman DS, ... & Follak S. 2015.

So GT was computed with age at flowering from Thompson & Stout 1991 (Thompson DJ & Stout DG. 1991. Duration of the juvenile period in diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa). Canadian Journal of Botany, 69:368–371). C. diffusa, like other semelparous perennials, flowers after reaching a critical rosette size. The age at which reproduction takes place thus depends on how fast the rosette grow (Powell RD. 1990. The Role of Spatial Pattern in the Population Biology of Centaurea Diffusa. The Journal of Ecology, 78:374-388). C. diffusa reproduces exclusively by seed. Approximately 95% of seedling recruitment takes place during late April (spring) when the ground is moist and temperatures are moderate, the remainder occurs in late September (autum). Spring seedling survival is initially high, but declines rapidly with the onset of the summer drought. The vegetative rosette stage persists for several years before semelparous flowering in dense populations (Powell RD. 1990. The Role of Spatial Pattern in the Population Biology of Centaurea Diffusa. The Journal of Ecology, 78:374-388). C. diffusa requires vernalization (overwinter) to flower (Thompson DJ & Stout DG. 1991. Duration of the juvenile period in diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa). Canadian Journal of Botany, 69:368–371). Each individual plant of C. diffusa can produce seeds with no primary dormancy or different levels of primary dormancy (NOLAN DG & UPADHYAYA MK. 1988.

Plant,Rumex crispus,Rumex crispus,3.07,"Rumex crispus is a perennial species. It is able to establish quickly from seed, also has a persistent taproot system, a massive production of seed that remain viable in the seed bank for decades. R. crispus seedlings can emerge throughout the growing season and seeds that remain on the  parent plant over winter posses a certain level of dormancy, leading to later and more intermittent emergence compared to the seeds dispersed in  autumn. Tillage that leads to fragmentation of the root system can stimulate sprouting of new shoots from the regenerative tissue of the taproot. Severed top fragments of roots sprouted faster and produced more shoot biomass than intact rootstocks. Germination of R. crispus seeds is stimulated by light and fluctuating temperatures. Seedling emergence can occur in flushes during the whole vegetation period, depending on weather conditions. Once the juvenile plant is established, the development goes through three phases: the rosette phase, the elongation phase, and the inflorescence phase. Depending on resource availability, R. crispus may flower in its first year or, more commonly, remain in the rosette phase through its first winter. Flowering takes place in late Spring to early Autum, occasional single plants can flower twice in a season. Surviving plants will overwinter as a rosette and can reproduce again in one or several years. Longevity of R. obtusifolius has been reported up to 5 years. Emergence from seeds sown in autumn showed a distinct peak in Spring, while peak emergence for seeds sown in early spring did not occur until late early Summer. Total mortality during the four year period of the field experiment was 24 percent, and total proportion of plants reaching a reproductive stage (i.e. flowered at least once) was 23 percent (Pye A. 2008.

Plant,Solidago canadensis var. scabra,Solidago altissima,NA,"Solidago altissima, is a perennial. Most ramets emerge in Spring from the apical tips of underground rhizomes, and increase in height until mid Summer, at which time flower heads begin to form. The apical tips of some rhizomes emerge the previous season, but the leaves of such rhizomes do not expand until spring (i.e. there are no overwintering rosettes). Rhizome growth is sympodial. The above-ground portion of ramets die over winter, and their daughter rhizomes remain dormant until the following spring. Ramets are not produced at the same node in successive years, so genet survival depends upon the new ramets that emerge in the spring from overwintering rhizomes. Although above-ground shoots die after one season, roots and rhizome connections persist for up to 5-6 years (fragmentation, not death) (Cain ML. 1990. Models of Clonal Growth in Solidago Altissima. The Journal of Ecology, 78:27-46). Clones of S. canadensis increase in both size and density and can persist for a considerable number of years, estimated at more than 100 yr (Werner, P. A., GROSS, R. S., & BRADBURY, I. K. (1980). THE BIOLOGY OF CANADIAN WEEDS.: 45. Solidago canadensis L. Canadian Journal of Plant Science, 60:1393-1409). Germination within the established vegetation was very rare: only 12 out of 150000 experimentally sown seeds (0.008%) became seedlings. The survival and growth of seedlings transplanted into closed vegetation increased with age and developmental stage. Nevertheless, no transplants flowered during the 24 months over which their fate was followed (Meyer AH & Schmid B. 1999.

Plant,Solidago gigantea,Solidago gigantea,2,"Solidago gigantea is very simmilar to Solidago altissima (see Solidago altissima GTimeNotes). Solidago gigantea is a tall, erect perennial herb with annual aboveground shoots and persistent belowground rhizomes. Solidago gigantea produces long-creeping plagiotropic, mostly purple or reddish rhizomes, mostly within the upper 10–20 cm of soil. In total, 3–50 rhizomes per ramet emerge close to the base of shoots from the previous year. Higher numbers have been observed after disturbances. Production of seeds, new shoots and new rhizomes occurs every year, and all aboveground shoots die back in autumn. Free carbohydrates are accumulated in the rhizome before the dormant period. Seedlings have never been observed within established patches of S. gigantea, suggesting that seeds are primarily important for long-distance dispersal and the colonization of new sites. However, seedlings may appear after a spring mowing, suggesting that successful establishment is dependent upon open conditions. In most cases, however, population increase is primarily the result of clonal growth. The relative significance of sexual reproduction increases with the age of the clone, whereas clonal growth is most essential during the first years after establishment. Individual clones are often easy to distinguish and frequently achieve 2–5 m diameter. Larger, older clones may contain thousands of ramets. Occasionally clones form ‘fairy circles’ around the initial centre of the genet. Under good conditions, almost all plants reproduce in their first year, and a single ramet produces up to 19,000 achenes. Under resource limited conditions, sexual reproduction is reduced to the benefit of vegetative growth (Weber E & Jakobs G. 2005. Biological flora of central Europe: Solidago gigantea Aiton. Flora - Morphology, Distribution, Functional Ecology of Plants, 200:109–118). Generation time should be long but I did not find any estimation. However, Meyer et al 2005 (Meyer G, Clare R, Weber E. 2005. An experimental test of the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis in goldenrod, Solidago gigantea. Oecologia, 144:299-307) observed that almost all plants grown from seeds flowered in the secon year, more than a half flowered in the first year. So, in newly colonized areas a generation time of 2 years can be assumed. This would be a severe underestimation for established populations."

Plant,Sporobolus alterniflorus,Spartina alterniflora,NA,"Spartina alterniflora have clonal growing, and clones can reach 100m diameter (Buhle ER, Feist BE & Hilborn R. 2012. Population dynamics and control of invasive Spartina alterniflora: inference and forecasting under uncertainty. Ecological Applications, 22:880–893). So, its generation time should be quite long.

Plant,Trifolium pratense,Trifolium pratense,2.7133,"Trifolium pratense seedlings appeared from March to May (namely spring cohort) and from September to November (namely autumn cohort) every year. Estimated seedling density ranged yearly from 18 to 1,215 seedlings/m 2 in the spring cohorts and from 1 to 245 seedlings/m 2 in the autumn cohorts, with an average of 199 and 86 seedlings/m2 , respectively. Half-life ranged yearly from 4 to 63 days for the spring cohorts and from 33 to 248 days for the autumn cohorts, with an average of 42 and 135 days, respectively. Of the 13,485 seedlings marked, no individuals survived for more than 4 years. Most of the individuals undergoing flowering (hereafter referred to as “flowering individuals”) originated from the autumn cohorts. Thirty-two percent of the survivors began to flower in the first summer after their appearance. Ratio of flowering individuals to survivors rose to 81% in the second summer and fell to 50% in the third summer. Although the number of flowering individuals decreased yearly, the ratio peaked 2 years after seedling appearance in both kinds of cohorts. (SAKANOUE S. 2002. Seedling appearance, survival andflowering of Trifolium pratense in a cutting meadow. Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly, 36:235–241).

Plant,Tussilago farfara,Tussilago farfara,2,"Tussilago farfara is a rhizomatous perennial. Germination takes place shortly after the seeds are shed in April or May (spring), and in suitable habitats a tap root is quickly developed. During the first summer contractile adventitious roots develop on the lowest nodes of the stem, followed shortly by rhizomes, initiated in the same region. By the autumn several large leaves may be present, rhizomes well developed, and inflorescence ('flower') buds will usually have been formed. In favourable situations vegetative reproduction occurs in the first season, the tips of certain rhizomes growing upwards to produce new plants. During the winter the leaves die, and all that is usually visible at the soil surface is a cluster of flower buds on the 'stock'. The stock is the non-rhizomatous portion of the stem, which bears the leaves in summer and the flowers in the following spring: it is normally short and thick, with very close internodes (Raunkiaer 1934). The flower buds continue their development during the winter, and early in the following spring the peduncles elongate rapidly and the flowers open. Seed dispersal occurs in April and May (spring). During the flowering period leaves are expanded by the new vegetative shoots at the tips of those rhizomes which were formed in the previous year. The flowering stock and the peduncles normally die after the seeds are shed, leading to fragmentation of the rhizome system. The new vegetative plants follow the same cycle of development as those in the previous year. It follows that normally rhizomes initiated in one year produce leafy shoots in the second year, and these shoots produce flowers in the third year (2 years old) of life of the rhizomes. After this they usually die, leaving further growth to new rhizome (Ogden J. 1974. The Reproductive Strategy of Higher Plants: II. The Reproductive Strategy of Tussilago Farfara L. The Journal of Ecology, 62:291-324). Generation Time is considered as the number of years required for a species to start producing seeds (this can underestimate the actual generation time) according to: Engler R, Randin CF, Vittoz P, Czáka T, Beniston M, Zimmermann NE & Guisan A. 2009. Predicting future distributions of mountain plants under climate change: does dispersal capacity matter?. Ecography, 32:34-45."
Plant,Ulex europaeus,Ulex europaeus,16,"Ulex europaeus starts to reproduce at 2 or 3 years old. It lives up to 30 years old. It follows the −3/2 law of self-thinning (Rees M & Hill RL. 2001. Large-scale disturbances, biological control and the dynamics of gorse populations. J Appl Ecol 38:364–377). We assume that an increase in fecundity with age compensates for mortality, so the contribution of each age to the next generation is constant. This assumption probably underestimates the generation time, but less than just using the age at maturity."
Plant,Veronica hederifolia,Veronica hederifolia,1,"Veronica hederifolia is a winter annual, most seedlings appeared in November- January (late Autumn to early winter).Flowering starts in March. Most of the individuals present at that time set seed and all had died by July (Summer). There was then a gap of 3-4 months before the next generation started to germinate and cohorts of seedlings continued to appear until April (Vegetative stage spans less than one year). Low temperatures in the winter appeared not to harm the seedlings of this species. Seeds require cold stratification to germinate (Boutin C & Harper JL. 1991. A Comparative Study of the Population Dynamics of Five Species of Veronica in Natural Habitats. The Journal of Ecology, 79:199-221). So, a generation time of one year is accurate."
